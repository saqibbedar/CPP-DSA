name: Data Structures & Algorithms
description: >
  This directory contains comprehensive implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in C++.
  All implementations are custom-built, including STL-like implementations, focusing on educational purposes
  and practical understanding.

purpose: >
  To provide a comprehensive collection of data structure and algorithm implementations
  with focus on custom implementations rather than using built-in STL containers.
